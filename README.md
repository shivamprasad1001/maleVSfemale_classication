# Male vs. Female Classification

This project aims to classify images based on gender (male or female) using deep learning techniques. The model can be used in applications like demographic studies, personalized marketing, and image-based analytics.

## Features
- **Gender Classification**: Detects and classifies images as male or female.
- **Simple and Effective Model**: A straightforward model optimized for basic classification tasks.
- **Data Augmentation**: Uses data augmentation to increase robustness and improve classification accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib

### Key Imports
This project makes use of the following imports from TensorFlow and other libraries for data preprocessing, model building, and visualization:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, load_img, img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv
import os
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/maleVSfemale_classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd maleVSfemale_classification
   ```


### Model Overview
- This model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure with TensorFlow's Sequential API.
- It classifies images into **two categories**: male and female.
- The model can be retrained or fine-tuned for improved accuracy based on additional data or different architectures.

### Usage
1. Run the main script to start the gender classification model:
   ```bash
   maleVSfemale_classification.ipynb
   ```
